# Expense-Tracker

This project is an Expense Tracker application built using Python's tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). It helps users manage their expenses by allowing them to input the amount and description of each expense they incur. The application visually displays the total expenses and provides a detailed breakdown of each expense entered.

__Key features of the Expense Tracker include:__

* Input fields for entering the amount and description of expenses.
* Validation to ensure that the amount entered is a valid numerical value and that it is positive.
* Display of total expenses in Indian Rupees (Rs.) with two decimal places precision.
* Dynamic updating of the expense details section to reflect the latest entries.
* A visually appealing interface with color-coded elements for better user experience.


__Users can easily add new expenses, view their total expenditure, and see a detailed list of expenses they have recorded. The project serves as a simple yet effective tool for individuals to track and manage their spending habits.__
